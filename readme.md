# Operationalize SQL Backups With Rubrik
The goal of this notebook is to give you an introduction to Rubrik APIs and the Powershell SDKs.  
This is targeted at the DBA as we are focusing on the backup and recovery operations that DBAs will most likely do with Rubrik.  
Since all things in Rubrik are an API call, all tasks that are done in the UI, can be done via a REST API Call.
