                "Database migrations are one of many tasks that DBAs will do that involve backups. Migrations can be done for any number of reasons, with upgrading to a new version of SQL Server being a primary one. \n",
                "\n",
                "A simple example of a database migration is your basic backup and restore. The backup is done on the original server and the restore is done on the new server. In our earlier examples, we showed how to take an on demand backup on the source server and then how to export that backup to new server. This works and is great for small databases or databases that are in SIMPLE recovery mode. \n",
                "\n",
                "Most databases, are not small and are in FULL recovery mode.  Additionally, outage windows provided by the business to do this work are getting smaller and smaller. When the time it takes backup and recover the databases in the migration plan exceeds the outage window provided by the business, DBAs need to look at alternative methods to meet the objective. Log shipping provides an avenue to do the bulk of the work ahead of time outside the outage window, without causing an outage. We can keep sending transactions happening in the original server to the new server, without any interruption of service. Then when it is time to migrate, you can finalize any transactions on the original server and move them to the new server.\n",

                "1. Wait for all logs to finish applying to the new server\n",
                "1. Set the source database to read only\n",
                "1. Set the source database to offline\n",

                "While this is a simple example of a cutover, your cutover process may be more complex. The below shows the combination of Powershell, Rubrik, and T-SQL all working together to make a seamless process to cutover a database in under a minute. Because we are using Log Shipping, the size of database is less of a concern at cutover time as amount of data change is. "
